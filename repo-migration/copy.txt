When migrating TFS GIT repositories to github, we are getting an error as authentication failed for the tfs git url. I assume this is due to the tfs server is 2017 which by dafault doesn't support PAT authentications. 

So I tried configuring the credentials to the runner machine via github --global credentials and it's strange that even my username and passwords are not working the the browser. 

So I would kindly request your inputs or thoughts, so that I can proceed accordingly
